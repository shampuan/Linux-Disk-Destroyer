Description: Securely and permanently wipes disks and flash drives on Linux systems.
 Linux Disk Destroyer uses the 'shred' command to overwrite block devices with random data, making it impossible to recover sensitive information. It provides a simple graphical interface built with PySide6 for easy and safe use. The process requires administrative authentication via pkexec.
